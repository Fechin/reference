## Glossary

### AI

- Prompt: input or query that guides an AI model in generating a
  response.[[s]](https://time.com/collections/the-ai-dictionary-from-allbusiness-com/7273982/definition-of-prompt-ai-prompt)
- Tokens: the smallest units of text processed by an AI model (e.g., words, subwords, characters, and punctuation marks)
  that varies depending on the model and the tokenization
  method.[[s]](https://time.com/collections/the-ai-dictionary-from-allbusiness-com/7273998/definition-of-token/)
- Token Limit: the maximum number of tokens an AI model can process in one
  interaction.[[s]](https://time.com/collections/the-ai-dictionary-from-allbusiness-com/7273998/definition-of-token/)
- Artificial intelligence (AI): technology that enables machines to simulate human cognition (e.g., human learning,
  comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and
  autonomy).[[s]](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence)
- AI Model: program trained on a set of data to recognize patterns or make decisions without further human
  intervention.[[s]](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-model)
- Large language model (LLM): transformer-based AI model trained on large text datasets to understand and generate
  natural language.[[s]](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models)
- Hallucination: AI response that detects nonexistent patterns and creates outputs that are nonsensical and
  inaccurate.[[s]](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations)
- Jailbreak: exploiting vulnerabilities in AI systems to bypass their ethical guidelines and perform restricted
  actions.[[s]](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-jailbreak)

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

- Zero-shot: prompt with no examples.[[s]](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/zero-shot-prompting)
- One-shot: prompt with one example.[[s]](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/one-shot-prompting)
- Few-shot: prompt with multiple examples.[[s]](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-prompting)
- Chain of thought: prompt guiding the model to break down complex reasoning into intermediate
  steps.[[s]](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-prompt-engineering?hl=en)

### Modes

- Study and learn: interactive learning that encourages step by step problem solving instead of giving direct
  answers.[[s]](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/)
- Create image: generate images from text
  prompts.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9260256-chatgpt-capabilities-overview)
- Think longer: performs deeper reasoning and generates more accurate, thoughtful, and detailed
  responses.[[s]](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5)
- Deep research: reads and synthesizes content across multiple online sources and produces cited structured
  outputs.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9260256-chatgpt-capabilities-overview)
- Web search: finds recent and real-time information
  online.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9260256-chatgpt-capabilities-overview)
- Canvas: separate interface for collaborative writing and coding that provides inline editing, suggestions, and
  feedback.[[s]](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/)

## Prompt Tips

### Efficiency

- Use the latest model as it's generally more capable and easier to
  prompt.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api)
- Provide general instructions at the start of conversations or when changing direction to avoid repeating them.
- Don't say polite phrases to the AI (e.g., please, thank you) as it adds unecessary computational
  costs.[[s]](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-spends-tens-of-millions-of-dollars-on-people-playing-please-and-thank-you-but-sam-altman-says-its-worth-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Don't explicitly ask the AI for help (e.g., can you help me do x?).
- Don't explicitly reference yourself unless clarifying multiple entities (e.g., I want to, do x for me).

### Clarity

- Be clear, specific, and provide enough context for the model to understand what you are
  asking.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10032626-prompt-engineering-best-practices-for-chatgpt)
- Prompt engineering often requires iterative refinement by adjusting wording, adding context, and simplifying
  requests.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10032626-prompt-engineering-best-practices-for-chatgpt)
- Break complex tasks into smaller focused
  prompts.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936848-how-do-i-create-a-good-prompt-for-an-ai-model)
- Specify focus areas, highlight important aspects, and ask for multiple
  options.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936848-how-do-i-create-a-good-prompt-for-an-ai-model)
- Provide examples of the desired output format to improve
  accuracy.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api)
- Focus on specifying what to do and not just what to
  avoid.[[s]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api)
- Before writing a prompt, identify the goal and expected
  output.[[s]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-prompt)
- Provide important keywords or phrases where possible to faciliate SEO and communicate term preferences to the AI
  model.[[s]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-prompt)
- Keep prompts precise and clean by omitting unnecessary or redundant
  information.[[s]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-prompt)
- Avoid conflicting terms that might confuse the
  AI.[[s]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-prompt)
- Open-ended questions usually provide more detailed responses than [closed-ended questions] and yes/no
  questions.[[s]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-prompt)
- When in doubt, ask AI to generate prompts for
  you.[[s]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-prompt)

### Security

- Don't share sensitive information with AI as you can't be certain how it's stored, if it will be shared, of if it's
  vulnerable to data
  breaches.[[s]](https://www.grantthornton.com/insights/articles/advisory/2023/anticipate-cybersecurity-and-privacy-risks-in-ai)
